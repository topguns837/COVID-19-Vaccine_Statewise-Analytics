Note: The data set contains data from 16-1-2021 to 15-8-2021 only . The data set also contains many missing values , which decreases the accuracy of this analytics project .

The above project used bar graphs , line plots , pie charts and spatial/geographical analysis using various modules like matplotlib ,seabron , plotly , pygeocoder etc for analysis. Other important libraries like Pandas , NumPy ,math etc are used to maneuver and combine data .
